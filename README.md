Exercise 1:
Write a function underArray which takes as parameters an array, and two
indexes and returns an array with the values of the boxes between the two indexes
example: Tab:
2 1 6 8 10 3 5 9 12 7
subArray(Tab, 2, 5) returns:
6 8 10
Call the function in a program that requires entry of an array
10 elements, asks for the indices, and displays the result
Note:
- The program controls the order of the indices passed as arguments
- The program asks the user if they want to enter a new list
